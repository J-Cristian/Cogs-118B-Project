# Cogs-118B-Project
In this project for COGS 118B, I use SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN to predict sentiment of movie reviews.
The docx file has the sentiment analysis papers I referenced, my thought process thourought the code, and my results.
The IMDB Dataset has all the data I used for my project.
Finally, the code I created for this project is in the ipynb file.
